## first - The support material for the 1st Edition of Head First Python

We really think there's a lot of benefit to be had from actually typing in the code and getting it to run. If you really don't want to type in the code yourself, check out the book's O'Reilly Media support page, where the code can be downloaded on a chapter-by-chapter, page-by-page basis.

That said, we do have some stuff referred to in the book - the data files, folder structures, modules, CSS, and so on - available above.  Enjoy!
